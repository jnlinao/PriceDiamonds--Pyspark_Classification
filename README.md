# Price Prediction of Diamonds :gem:            

### Use Case: Utilizing Big Data Tools to handle, manipulate, and model volume heavy data

## Business Problem :thought_balloon:
Diamonds are one of the most precious and valued materials in the world and their valuation is clearly represented by the massive costs and resources to source them at the utmost quality to be used in jewelry. There are a multitude of factors to be taken into consideration when calculating how much diamonds are actually worth. 

Diamonds have always been and are still becoming a prominent market in many considerable aspects as we see a global increase in demand, production, value, and distribution. Holistically, the worth of the diamond business critically pillars on how all clients, end users, distributors, and sources alike perceive the true valuation of these stones themselves. There is a business need to be able to legitimately price these diamonds. Otherwise, mistaken valuation could cause a number of issues that lead to lost profit such as fraudulent sales and detriment to brand loyalty. 

## Data Challenges and Approach :mount_fuji:
1. How can we handle big data?
  * **Utilizing data stack of AWS S3 and EMS to conduct data science analysis with Pyspark via Jupyter Notebooks**
2. What data structures to use? 
  * **Employ Pyspark RDD's. RDD's improve performance by keeping data in-memory. RDD provides fault tolerance efficiently, by defining a program interface. They also save lots of time and improve efficiency.**
3. What machine learning model will best fit our use case?
* **Evaluated model performance for Gradient Boosted Trees and Linear Regression**
